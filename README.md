# SmartRoute REST API


## Portfolio Project for Holberton School

This project is made by the FullDevs Team as a portfolio project for the final project in the end of Foundation in Holberton School. This project is based on the challenge proposed by Quick Company which is a logistics transportation company, the problem they have is that in some transportation routes they calculate the freight costs by using fixed costs values on specific routes.
We as a Team we try to solve this problem by developing a Rest API that provide the service of the cost calculation that carries a route according to a vehicle.


### Sample:

## Why this project is useful?

Our solution provides the cost calculation within a route (currently for Colombia), the optimize route between an origin place and destination place, the tolls within a route, distance and duration of the trip, CRUD operation for data vehicles, CRUD operation for data tolls.


## How users can get started with?

### pre-requisite
Before starting, it is necessary to have already installed and configured in your system:
  - Git ver. 2.11+
  - NodeJS ver. 12.16.1+
  - Redis ver. 6.0.8+ (running on port 6379)
  - MongoDB ver. 4.2.10+
  
Google Maps and OpenRouteService Maps API KEY's.

Check these pages for more information about API KEY's:

- https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/
- https://openrouteservice.org/

### start üöÄ

Clone the repository to have the local project:
``` sh
git clone git@github.com:SneyderHOL/Quick_Project.git
```
Get inside the path of the project:
``` sh
cd Quick_Project
```
Installing dependecies:
``` sh
npm install
```
Declare the following variables inside the file .env:
``` sh
- GOOGLE_API=(here goes your google API key)
- API_OPENROUTES=(here goes your openrouteservice API key)
- URL_DB=mongodb://localhost (if you're using a local MongoDB)
```
Start the application with:
``` sh
npm start
```
Now you can start using the API with the following endpoints:

- /tolls
- /vehicles
- /routes/tolls

You can check the API documentation within a browser in:

- /api-docs
